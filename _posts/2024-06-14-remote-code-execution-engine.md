## 1. Introduction

After a long hiatus, I am back with renewed passion and energy, eager to delve deeper into the Scala ecosystem. This time, I am committed to building something tangible and useful with the tools available. Let's embark on this exciting journey of exploration and learning together.

The greatest benefit of small side projects is the unique knowledge boost which can potentially be handy later in career.

In this article we will attempt to build the remote code execution engine - the backend platform for websites such as [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com), [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) and others.

If, for some reason you're unfamiliar with the websites mentioned above, the basic usage flow is described below:
- Client sends code
- Backend runs it and responds with output

There you go, sounds simple, right?

Right, right... 

Can you imagine how many things can go wrong here? It's the devil smirking in the corner, knowing, that the possibilities for failure are endless, however, we should address at least some of them.

To give you a quick idea: a separate blog post can be written only about the security, not to mention scalability, extensibility and a few other compulsory properties to make it production ready.

The goal isn't to build the best one, nor it is to compete with the existing ones. 

Put simply, the goal of this project is to get familiar with `Pekko` and its modules such as `pekko-http`, `pekko-stream`, `pekko-cluster` and a few interesting concepts revolving around actor model concurrency, such as: 
- cluster nodes and formation
- cluster aware routers
- remote worker actors
- actor lifecycle and hierarchy
- actor supervision strategies
- actor location transparency
- message serialization
- and so on...

Let's get started then, shall we?

## 2. Project Structure

We will use `Scala 3.4.1`, `sbt 1.9.9`, `docker`, `pekko` and its modules to complete our project.

The initial project skeleton looks like the following:

![alt "Project skeleton"](../images/braindrill/project_skeleton.png)

- `assets` folder contains images mainly for setting up good `README.md`
- `src` contains production and test code
- `target` will store the compiled `.jar` file that we will run later
- `.gitignore` for `git` to ignore some changes
- `.scalafmt.conf` for formatting Scala code
- `build.sbt` for defining build steps, external library dependencies and so on
- `deploy.sh` is a useful script for deploying the project locally within using `docker-compose`
- `docker-compose.yaml` for defining apps, their configuration and properties
- `Dockerfile` blueprint for running the app inside container
- `README.md` instructions for setting up the project locally

Nothing fancy, let's move on `build.sbt`:
```scala
ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "3.4.1"

val PekkoVersion = "1.0.2"
val PekkoHttpVersion = "1.0.1"
val PekkoManagementVersion = "1.0.0"

assembly / assemblyMergeStrategy := {
  case PathList("META-INF", "versions", "9", "module-info.class") => MergeStrategy.discard
  case PathList("module-info.class")                              => MergeStrategy.discard
  case x =>
    val oldStrategy = (assembly / assemblyMergeStrategy).value
    oldStrategy(x)
}

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.apache.pekko" %% "pekko-actor-typed" % PekkoVersion,
  "org.apache.pekko" %% "pekko-stream" % PekkoVersion,
  "org.apache.pekko" %% "pekko-http" % PekkoHttpVersion,
  "org.apache.pekko" %% "pekko-cluster-typed" % PekkoVersion,
  "org.apache.pekko" %% "pekko-serialization-jackson" % PekkoVersion,
  "ch.qos.logback" % "logback-classic" % "1.5.6"
)

lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .settings(
    name := "braindrill",
    assembly / assemblyJarName := "braindrill.jar",
    assembly / mainClass := Some("BrainDrill")
  )
```

As shown:
- we mainly use `pekko` libraries for main work and `logback-classic` for logging
- `root` definition which defines the `name`, `assemblyJarName` and `mainClass`
- all of which is used by `sbt assembly` to turn our code into `braindrill.jar`

and a one line definition in `project/plugins.sbt`:
```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-assembly" % "2.1.1") // SBT plugin for using assembly command
```

## 3. Project Architecture

After a few iterations I came up with the architecture that can be horizontally scaled, if required. 
Ideally, such projects must be scaled easily as long as the load is increased. 

For that we use tools such as Kubernetes or other container orchestration platforms. To make local development and deployment simpler we'll be using docker containers. More precisely we'll be using `docker-compose` to run a few containers together so that they form the cluster.

`docker-compose` doesn't support scalability out of the box because it's static, it means that we can't magically add new `worker` node to the running system. Again, for that we'd use Kubernetes, but it is out of the scope of this project.

We have a `master` node and its role is to be the task distributor among `worker` nodes. 

`http` is exposed on `master` node, acting as a gateway to outside world.

### 3.1 Architecture Diagram

![alt "Project skeleton"](../images/braindrill/diagram.png)

Let's explain step by step what happens during code execution:

- User sends request at POST `http://localhost/python` with `python` code attached to request body
- `http` processes the request
- randomly chosen `load balancer` sends message to `worker router` on some node
- `worker router` sends message to `worker` which starts execution
- ... skipping lots of details ...
- `worker` responds to `load balancer` once the code is executed
- `load balancer` forwards message to `http` and user receives the output

### 3.2 Docker runtime

There are a few options to my knowledge for executing the submitted code with the help of docker containers. All I can do is redirect you to the great [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27879713/is-it-ok-to-run-docker-from-inside-docker) which expands on this issue.

Long story short, I decided to go with [DooD - Docker out of Docker](https://tdongsi.github.io/blog/2017/04/23/docker-out-of-docker/).

`DooD` Uses the host's Docker daemon by mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` into the container.

It means that if the host machine has the docker engine installed on it:
- it can start container `A` using `/var/run/docker.sock` which listens for commands
- it can start "sibling" container `B` by executing commands such as `docker run ...` from container `A`, using `/var/run/docker.sock`

In our domain terms:
- container `A` will be `worker-1` container, which will be starting sibling containers
- sibling containers will be short-lived, limited (CPU, RAM, timeout) containers which run `python`, `java` and such processes

Advantages of `DooD`:
- Efficient: Direct use of host resources.
- Simple: No extra Docker daemons.
- Fast: No nested virtualization overhead.
- Resource-efficient: Shared daemon optimizes resource use.

Disadvantages:
- Security risk: Access to host Docker daemon.
- Less isolation: Shared daemon.

### 3.3 docker-compose

Since we want to run a `pekko` cluster we could use `docker-compose` and its declarative definitions for cluster components such as `master` and `worker` nodes, with shared volume, image names, ports mappings, environment variables and so on.

This is how `docker-compose.yaml` could look like in the root directory of our project:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  master:
    image: braindrill:latest
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: 'master'
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    ports:
      - '1600:1600'
      - '8080:8080'
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - engine:/data
    working_dir: /app
    environment:
      CLUSTER_IP: 'master'
      CLUSTER_PORT: '1600'
      CLUSTER_ROLE: 'master'
      SEED_IP: 'master'
  worker-1:
    image: braindrill:latest
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    ports:
      - '17350:17350'
    security_opt:
      - 'seccomp=unconfined'
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - engine:/data
    working_dir: /app
    environment:
      CLUSTER_IP: 'worker-1'
      CLUSTER_PORT: '17350'
      CLUSTER_ROLE: 'worker'
      SEED_IP: 'master'
      SEED_PORT: '1600'
  worker-2:
    image: braindrill:latest
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    ports:
      - '17351:17351'
    security_opt:
      - 'seccomp=unconfined'
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - engine:/data
    working_dir: /app
    environment:
      CLUSTER_IP: 'worker-2'
      CLUSTER_PORT: '17351'
      CLUSTER_ROLE: 'worker'
      SEED_IP: 'master'
      SEED_PORT: '1600'
  worker-3:
    image: braindrill:latest
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    ports:
      - '17352:17352'
    security_opt:
      - 'seccomp=unconfined'
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - engine:/data
    working_dir: /app
    environment:
      CLUSTER_IP: 'worker-3'
      CLUSTER_PORT: '17352'
      CLUSTER_ROLE: 'worker'
      SEED_IP: 'master'
      SEED_PORT: '1600'

volumes:
  engine:
    external: true
```

This `docker-compose.yaml` file sets up a `Pekko` cluster with one `master` and three `worker` services. 

Key points include:

1. Version: Uses Docker Compose version 3.
2. Services: Defines four services - `master`, `worker-1`, `worker-2`, and `worker-3`.

#### Master:
- Image: Uses `braindrill:latest` and builds from the Dockerfile in the current context. `braindrill` image will be built using a special `Dockerfile` definition which will be covered later. For better automation, we could also write a deployment shell script that automates all those details. 
- Container Name: `master` - in Pekko terms - master node
- Ports: Maps `1600:1600` and `8080:8080`
- Volumes: Mounts Docker socket for `DooD` and `engine` volume for sharing temporary files (e.g `python123.py`, `Program123.java`) where user code will be written.
- Environment Variables: Sets cluster details (`CLUSTER_IP`, `CLUSTER_PORT`, `CLUSTER_ROLE`, `SEED_IP`).

#### Workers:
- Image: Uses `braindrill:latest` and builds from the Dockerfile in the current context.
- Ports: Each worker maps a unique port (`17350`, `17351`, `17352`).
- Security: Disables default security profiles (`seccomp=unconfined`).
- Volumes: Mounts Docker socket for `DooD` and `engine` volume for sharing temporary files where user code will be written.
- Environment Variables: Sets cluster and seed details for each worker.

#### Common Settings:
- TTY and stdin_open: Enabled for interactive use.
- Working Directory: `/app`.

#### Volumes:
- Engine: An external volume named `engine` which is necessary to share temporary program files that will be later executed.

### 3.4 Dockerfile

`Dockerfile` is a declarative file for building a `docker` image.

Pretty simple and self-explanatory:

```shell
# Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image
FROM hseeberger/scala-sbt:17.0.2_1.6.2_3.1.1

# Update the repository sources list and install required packages
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y \
    docker.io # docker.io needed to run `docker` commands from the container itself

# Set the working directory to /tmp
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Build the Scala project
RUN sbt clean assembly

# Run application when the container launches
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "target/scala-3.4.1/braindrill.jar"]
```

### 3.5 Local deployment shell script

Deployment shell script is a handy tool that enables us to run the project locally with a single command.

The goal is to automate the following:
- creating an image - `braindrill`
- creating a volume - `engine`
- pulling programming language runtime images (`java`, `python` and others)
- redeploying the nodes with the new version of `braindrill` image if required

So, it could look like the following (inspired by ChatGPT):

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Function to print help message
print_help() {
    echo "Usage: $0 [rebuild]"
    echo "  rebuild   Add --build flag to docker-compose up"
}

# Check for the "rebuild" argument
DOCKER_COMPOSE_CMD="docker-compose up"
if [ "$1" == "rebuild" ]; then
    DOCKER_COMPOSE_CMD="docker-compose up --build"
elif [ -n "$1" ]; then
    print_help
    exit 1
fi

# Create Docker volume if it doesn't exist
VOLUME_NAME="engine"
if docker volume inspect "$VOLUME_NAME" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "Docker volume '$VOLUME_NAME' already exists."
else
  echo "Creating Docker volume '$VOLUME_NAME'."
  docker volume create "$VOLUME_NAME"
fi

# Docker images to be pulled
DOCKER_IMAGES=(
  "openjdk:17"
  "python"
  "node"
  "ruby"
  "perl"
  "php"
)

# Pull Docker images in parallel if they don't already exist
for IMAGE in "${DOCKER_IMAGES[@]}"; do
  if docker image inspect "$IMAGE" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Docker image '$IMAGE' already exists."
  else
    echo "Pulling Docker image '$IMAGE' in the background."
    docker pull "$IMAGE" &
  fi
done

# Wait for all background jobs to complete
wait
echo "All Docker images pulled."

echo "Running command: $DOCKER_COMPOSE_CMD"
$DOCKER_COMPOSE_CMD
```

This deployment shell script (`deploy.sh`) sets up a Docker environment and optionally rebuilds the Docker images. Key points include:

1. Help Function:
   - Provides usage instructions for the script.

2. Rebuild Argument Check:
   - If "rebuild" is passed as an argument, the script adds `--build` to the `docker-compose up` command.
   - If an unrecognized argument is passed, it prints the help message and exits.

3. Docker Volume Management:
   - Checks if a Docker volume named `engine` exists.
   - If not, it creates the volume which is necessary for worker containers to access temporary files to be executed later

4. Docker Image Management:
   - Defines a list of Docker images to be pulled (`openjdk:17`, `python`, `node`, `ruby`, `perl`, `php`).
   - Checks if each image exists locally and pulls it in the background if it does not.

5. Parallel Image Pulling:
   - Uses background jobs to pull Docker images simultaneously for efficiency.
   - Waits for all background jobs to complete.

6. Run Docker Compose:
   - Executes the `docker-compose up` command, with or without the `--build` flag based on the initial argument.

## 4. Configuration

Before writing any code let's check `resources/application.conf` which is defined in [HOCON format](https://docs.spongepowered.org/stable/en/server/getting-started/configuration/hocon.html):
```hocon
pekko {
  actor {
    provider = cluster

    serialization-bindings {
      "serialization.CborSerializable" = jackson-cbor
    }
  }
  http {
    host-connection-pool {
        max-open-requests = 256
    }
  }
  remote {
    artery {
      canonical.hostname = ${clustering.ip}
      canonical.port = ${clustering.port}
      large-message-destinations=[
        "/temp/load-balancer-*"
      ]
    }
  }
  cluster {
    seed-nodes = [
      "pekko://"${clustering.cluster.name}"@"${clustering.seed-ip}":"${clustering.seed-port}
    ]
    roles = [${clustering.role}]
    downing-provider-class = "org.apache.pekko.cluster.sbr.SplitBrainResolverProvider"
  }
}

http {
  port = 8080
  host = "0.0.0.0"
}


clustering {
 ip = "127.0.0.1"
 ip = ${?CLUSTER_IP}
 port = 1600
 port = ${?CLUSTER_PORT}
 role = ${?CLUSTER_ROLE}
 seed-ip = "127.0.0.1"
 seed-ip = ${?CLUSTER_IP}
 seed-ip = ${?SEED_IP}
 seed-port = 1600
 seed-port = ${?SEED_PORT}
 cluster.name = ClusterSystem
}
```

This file configures various settings for the Pekko application, including actor system properties, HTTP settings, remote communication, and clustering parameters:

#### Pekko Actor System Configuration
- `provider = cluster`: This setting specifies that the actor system will use clustering capabilities.
- `serialization-bindings`: This section defines serialization bindings for specific classes. Here, any class implementing `serialization.CborSerializable` will be serialized using the `jackson-cbor` serializer.

#### HTTP Configuration
- `host-connection-pool.max-open-requests`: This setting specifies the maximum number of open requests in the HTTP host connection pool. It is set to 256.

#### Remote Communication Configuration
- `remote.artery`: This section configures the Artery transport (a remoting mechanism in Pekko).
- `canonical.hostname`: This sets the hostname for the actor system, which is derived from `clustering.ip`.
- `canonical.port`: This sets the port for the actor system, which is derived from `clustering.port`.
- `large-message-destinations`: Specifies destinations for large messages. In this case, any destination matching the pattern `/temp/load-balancer-*` will be treated as a large message destination.

#### Cluster Configuration
- `seed-nodes`: Defines the initial contact points for the cluster, using placeholders for cluster name, seed IP, and seed port.
- `roles`: Specifies the roles of the cluster node, derived from clustering.role.
- `downing-provider-class`: Specifies the class for handling split-brain scenarios. Here, it's set to `SplitBrainResolverProvider`.
 
#### Http Server Configuration
- `http.port`: Sets the HTTP server port to 8080.
- `http.host`: Sets the HTTP server host to 0.0.0.0, meaning it will bind to all available network interfaces.

#### Clustering Variables
- `ip`: Default IP address for clustering is 127.0.0.1. It can be overridden by the environment variable `CLUSTER_IP`.
- `port`: Default port for clustering is 1600. It can be overridden by the environment variable `CLUSTER_PORT`.
- `role`: Role of the cluster node, which can be set using the environment variable `CLUSTER_ROLE`.
- `seed-ip`: Default seed IP address is 127.0.0.1. It can be overridden by `CLUSTER_IP` or `SEED_IP`.
- `seed-port`: Default seed port is 1600. It can be overridden by the environment variable `SEED_PORT`.
- `cluster.name`: Name of the cluster, set to `ClusterSystem`.

This configuration file is designed to be flexible, allowing for environment-specific overrides while providing sensible defaults, it plays crucial role with running the pekko cluster within the containers.

### 4.1 transformation.conf

The project also requires a special configuration for capturing properties for domain objects such as `worker`, `load-balancer` and so on.

```hocon
include "application"

transformation {
  workers-per-node = 32
  load-balancer = 3
}
```
Here, it simply means that each node will have 32 worker actors and master node will have 3 load balancer actors.
In real world, choosing those numbers would depend on multiple variables that must be collected and analyzed in production.
In my opinion, those numbers are optimized based on empirical evidence rather than theoretical results.

### 4.2 Serialization

Since we're building a cluster we need to keep in mind that actor messages must be serialized over wire. It means that messages could be sent from JVM to JVM which requires enabling the serialization protocol. 

For that we need a simple trait definition under `serialization` package, as we've already defined in configuration.

```scala
package serialization

// just a marker trait to tell pekko to serialize messages into CBOR using Jackson for sending over the network
trait CborSerializable
```

## 5. Actors

In this section we will write the code for actors that will do the real job - code execution.

Those actors will be:
- `Worker`: actor that initiates code execution
- `FileHandler`: child actor of `Worker` which prepares the temporary file before executing it
- `CodeExecutor`: child actor of `FileHandler` which starts the process and collects output

Now, time to dig into the details.

### 5.1 Worker

Let's quickly evaluate what we would expect from `Worker`.

`Worker` actor will live on `worker` node and will be reacting to `StartExecution` message. 

Also, during runtime, it must be aware of which languages are supported, so that it quickly replies something like `ExecutionFailed` response with the message `"unsupported language"`.

For successful case, we could have `ExecutionSucceeded` message that will be forwarded back to the original sender.

How about making `Worker` actor work within a cluster? We said earlier that the `Worker` actor will be expecting messages from `master` node, here enters remoting and other good stuff. 

Somehow, `Worker` actor must be discovered within `pekko` cluster so that messages can be routed to it, for that, we'll be using `ServiceKey` and later, `Router`-s which are special actors.

So, keeping all this in mind the code could look like this:

```scala
package workers

import org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.receptionist.ServiceKey
import workers.children.FileHandler.In.PrepareFile
import org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.{ActorRef, Behavior}
import org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.scaladsl.Behaviors
import serialization.CborSerializable
import workers.children.FileHandler

import scala.util.*

object Worker:

  // this enables Worker to be discovered by actors living on other nodes
  val WorkerRouterKey = ServiceKey[Worker.StartExecution]("worker-router.StartExecution")

  // simple model for grouping compiler, file extension and docker image for the programming language
  private final case class LanguageSpecifics(
      compiler: String,
      extension: String,
      dockerImage: String
  )

  // language specifics per language
  private val languageSpecifics: Map[String, LanguageSpecifics] =
    Map(
      "java" -> LanguageSpecifics(
        compiler = "java",
        extension = ".java",
        dockerImage = "openjdk:17"
      ),
      "python" -> LanguageSpecifics(
        compiler = "python3",
        extension = ".py",
        dockerImage = "python"
      ),
      "ruby" -> LanguageSpecifics(
        compiler = "ruby",
        extension = ".ruby",
        dockerImage = "ruby"
      ),
      "perl" -> LanguageSpecifics(
        compiler = "perl",
        extension = ".pl",
        dockerImage = "perl"
      ),
      "javascript" -> LanguageSpecifics(
        compiler = "node",
        extension = ".js",
        dockerImage = "node"
      ),
      "php" -> LanguageSpecifics(
        compiler = "php",
        extension = ".php",
        dockerImage = "php"
      )
    )
  
  // a parent type for modeling incoming messages
  sealed trait In

  final case class StartExecution(
      code: String,
      language: String,
      replyTo: ActorRef[Worker.ExecutionResult]
  ) extends In
      with CborSerializable

  // a parent type that models successful and failed executions
  sealed trait ExecutionResult extends In:
    def value: String

  final case class ExecutionSucceeded(value: String) extends ExecutionResult with CborSerializable
  final case class ExecutionFailed(value: String) extends ExecutionResult with CborSerializable

  // constructor for creating Behavior[In]
  def apply(workerRouter: Option[ActorRef[Worker.ExecutionResult]] = None): Behavior[In] =
    Behaviors.setup[In]: ctx =>
      val self = ctx.self

      Behaviors.receiveMessage[In]:
        case msg @ StartExecution(code, lang, replyTo) =>
          ctx.log.info(s"{} processing StartExecution", self)
          languageSpecifics get lang match
            case Some(specifics) =>
              val fileHandler = ctx.spawn(FileHandler(), s"file-handler")
              ctx.log.info(s"{} sending PrepareFile to {}", self, fileHandler)

              fileHandler ! FileHandler.In.PrepareFile(
                name =
                  s"$lang${Random.nextInt}${specifics.extension}", // random number for avoiding file overwrite/shadowing
                compiler = specifics.compiler,
                dockerImage = specifics.dockerImage,
                code = code,
                replyTo = ctx.self
              )
            case None =>
              val reason = s"unsupported language: $lang"
              ctx.log.warn(s"{} failed execution due to: {}", self, reason)

              replyTo ! Worker.ExecutionFailed(reason)

          // register original requester
          apply(workerRouter = Some(replyTo))

        case msg @ ExecutionSucceeded(result) =>
          ctx.log.info(s"{} sending ExecutionSucceeded to {}", self, workerRouter)
          workerRouter.foreach(_ ! msg)

          apply(workerRouter = None)

        case msg @ ExecutionFailed(reason) =>
          ctx.log.info(s"{} sending ExecutionFailed to {}", self, workerRouter)
          workerRouter.foreach(_ ! msg)

          apply(workerRouter = None)
```

So, `Worker` actor is designed to handle code execution requests for various programming languages. Here's a concise breakdown:

- `ServiceKey`: `WorkerRouterKey` enables the actor to be discovered across different nodes.
- `LanguageSpecifics`: A case class and a map define compiler, file extension, and Docker image specifics for each supported programming language.
- `Messages`: The `In` trait and its implementations (`StartExecution`, `ExecutionResult`, `ExecutionSucceeded`, `ExecutionFailed`) model the messages the actor can handle.
- `Behavior Setup`: The `apply` method sets up the actor's behavior, processing incoming messages.
- On `StartExecution`, it logs the event, checks for language support, and spawns a `FileHandler` actor to handle file preparation. If the language isn't supported, it responds with `ExecutionFailed`.
- On `ExecutionSucceeded` and `ExecutionFailed`, it logs the outcome and sends the result back to the requester.
- `ActorRef Management`: Manages the original requester (`workerRouter` which will be defined later) to send back execution results.
- The imports `import workers.children.FileHandler.In.PrepareFile` and `import workers.children.FileHandler` will be covered next, focusing on file preparation logic.

With this, we can move to `FileHandler`.

### 5.2 File Handler

`FileHandler` will be a local child actor for the `Worker` actor on the same `worker` node.

We've already seen `PrepareFile` message mentioned in `Worker` actor, but there must also be defined something like `FilePrepared` and `FilePreparationFailed` messages for covering both possible outcomes.

If file will be created, `FileHandler` should simply proceed with code execution, otherwise it should report immediately why the process failed.

With those expectations in mind, the code could look like the following:

```scala
package workers.children

import org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.{ActorRef, Terminated}
import org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.scaladsl.Behaviors
import org.apache.pekko.stream.scaladsl.{FileIO, Source}
import org.apache.pekko.util.ByteString
import workers.children.FileHandler.In.PrepareFile
import workers.Worker

import java.io.File
import java.nio.file.Path
import scala.concurrent.Future
import scala.util.*

object FileHandler:

  enum In:
    case PrepareFile(
        name: String,
        code: String,
        compiler: String,
        dockerImage: String,
        replyTo: ActorRef[Worker.In]
    )
    case FilePrepared(
        compiler: String,
        file: File,
        dockerImage: String,
        replyTo: ActorRef[Worker.In]
    )
    case FilePreparationFailed(why: String, replyTo: ActorRef[Worker.In])

  def apply() = Behaviors
    .receive[In]: (ctx, msg) =>
      import CodeExecutor.In.*
      import ctx.executionContext
      import ctx.system

      val self = ctx.self

      ctx.log.info(s"{}: processing {}", self, msg)

      msg match
        case In.PrepareFile(name, code, compiler, dockerImage, replyTo) =>
          val filepath = s"/data/$name"
          val asyncFile = for
            file <- Future(File(filepath))
            _ <- Source
              .single(code)
              .map(ByteString.apply)
              .runWith(FileIO.toPath(Path.of(filepath)))
          yield file

          ctx.pipeToSelf(asyncFile):
            case Success(file) => In.FilePrepared(compiler, file, dockerImage, replyTo)
            case Failure(why)  => In.FilePreparationFailed(why.getMessage, replyTo)

          Behaviors.same

        case In.FilePrepared(compiler, file, dockerImage, replyTo) =>
          val codeExecutor = ctx.spawn(CodeExecutor(), "code-executor")
          // observe child for self-destruction
          ctx.watch(codeExecutor)
          ctx.log.info("{} prepared file, sending Execute to {}", self, codeExecutor)
          codeExecutor ! Execute(compiler, file, dockerImage, replyTo)

          Behaviors.same

        case In.FilePreparationFailed(why, replyTo) =>
          ctx.log.warn(
            "{} failed during file preparation due to {}, sending ExecutionFailed to {}",
            self,
            why,
            replyTo
          )
          replyTo ! Worker.ExecutionFailed(why)

          Behaviors.stopped
    .receiveSignal:
      case (ctx, Terminated(ref)) =>
        ctx.log.info(s"{} is stopping because child actor: {} was stopped", ctx.self, ref)

        Behaviors.stopped
```

The details:
- `Messages`: The `In` enum defines messages the actor can handle, including `PrepareFile`, `FilePrepared`, and `FilePreparationFailed`.
- `Behavior Setup`: The `apply` method sets up the actor's behavior
- On receiving `PrepareFile`, it logs the event, attempts to write the code to a file asynchronously, and uses `pipeToSelf` pattern to handle the result.
- On `FilePrepared`, it spawns a `CodeExecutor` actor to execute the code, watches it for termination, and sends an `Execute` message to the executor.
- On `FilePreparationFailed`, it logs the failure and sends an `ExecutionFailed` message back to the requester.
 
And we arrived at the point where we can talk about the most important actor - `CodeExecutor`.

## 5.3 CodeExecutor

`CodeExecutor` actor will be a child of the local `FileHandler` actor on the same `worker` node.

The main responsibility for `CodeExecutor` is to execute code and return the output.

`CodeExecutor` actor is complex in nature due to the following reasons:
- code must be executed in a short-lived docker container
- code can cause memory issues
- code can cause cpu issues
- code can result in an accidental infinite loop
- code can be accumulating too much output
- and so on...

To tackle all this, we need to write a special logic and model the aforementioned concepts in a sensible way.

After struggling with those issues for a week or so, I managed to refine `CodeExecutor` iteratively, ending up with the following:

```scala
package workers.children

import org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.ActorRef
import org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.scaladsl.Behaviors

  private val KiloByte = 1024 // 1024 bytes
  private val MegaByte = KiloByte * KiloByte // 1,048,576 bytes
  private val TwoMegabytes = 2 * MegaByte // 2,097,152 bytes

  private val AdjustedMaxSizeInBytes =
    (TwoMegabytes * 20) / 100 // 419,430 bytes, which is approx 409,6 KB or 0.4 MB

  // max size of output when the code is run, if it exceeds the limit then we let the user know to reduce logs or printing
  private val MaxOutputSize = AdjustedMaxSizeInBytes

  enum In:
    case Execute(compiler: String, file: File, dockerImage: String, replyTo: ActorRef[Worker.In])
    case Executed(output: String, exitCode: Int, replyTo: ActorRef[Worker.In])
    case ExecutionFailed(why: String, replyTo: ActorRef[Worker.In])
    case ExecutionSucceeded(output: String, replyTo: ActorRef[Worker.In])

  private case object TooLargeOutput extends Throwable with NoStackTrace {
    override def getMessage: String =
      "the code is generating too large output, try reducing logs or printing"
  }

  def apply() = Behaviors.receive[In]: (ctx, msg) =>
    import Worker.*
    import ctx.executionContext
    import ctx.system

    val self = ctx.self

    msg match
      case In.Execute(compiler, file, dockerImage, replyTo) =>
        ctx.log.info(s"{}: executing submitted code", self)
        val asyncExecuted: Future[In.Executed] = for
          // timeout --signal=SIGKILL 2 docker run --rm --ulimit cpu=1 --memory=20m -v engine:/data -w /data rust rust /data/r.rust

          )

        yield In.Executed(
          output = if success.nonEmpty then success else error,
          exitCode = exitCode,
          replyTo = replyTo
        )

        ctx.pipeToSelf(asyncExecuted):
          case Success(executed) =>
            ctx.log.info("{}: executed submitted code", self)
            executed.exitCode match
              case 124 | 137 =>
                In.ExecutionFailed(
                  "The process was aborted because it exceeded the timeout",
                  replyTo

    StreamConverters.fromInputStream(() => stream)

  private def run(commands: String*)(using ec: ExecutionContext) =
    Future(sys.runtime.exec(commands.toArray))
```

Here it's worth going into details since it's the meat of the whole project.

#### Constants and Imports

1. Constants:
    - `KiloByte`, `MegaByte`, `TwoMegabytes`: Constants for byte size calculations.
    - `AdjustedMaxSizeInBytes`: Adjusted max size for output (approximately 409.6 KB).
    - `MaxOutputSize`: Maximum allowed output size for the code execution.

2. Imports:
    - Imports various `Pekko` and `Scala` utilities for actor behavior, stream handling, and future operations.

#### Messages (`In`)
The `In` enum defines messages the actor can handle:
- `Execute`: Message to execute a given file with a specific compiler and Docker image, and send the result to the specified `ActorRef`.
- `Executed`: Message indicating the execution result, including output and exit code.
- `ExecutionFailed`: Message indicating the execution failed with a reason.
- `ExecutionSucceeded`: Message indicating the execution succeeded with the output.

#### Throwable for Large Output
A custom `TooLargeOutput` throwable is defined to handle scenarios where the code output exceeds the allowed size.

#### Behavior Definition
The `apply` method defines the actor's behavior using Akka's `Behaviors.receive` method:

#### `In.Execute` case
1. Logging: Logs that code execution has started.
2. Running Docker Command: Constructs and runs a Docker command with a 2-second timeout and memory limits.
    - The Docker command binds the `engine` volume, sets the working directory to `/data`, and runs the provided compiler and file within the specified Docker image.
3. Handling Streams: Handles both the standard and error streams from the Docker process.
4. Reading Output: Reads the success and error streams and joins them with the exit code.
5. Deleting File: Schedules the file for deletion to free up memory.
6. Piping Result: Uses `ctx.pipeToSelf` to handle the asynchronous execution result.
    - On success, checks the exit code and constructs appropriate messages (`ExecutionFailed` for specific exit codes or `ExecutionSucceeded`).
    - On failure, logs the exception and constructs an `ExecutionFailed` message.

#### `In.ExecutionSucceeded` case
1. Logging: Logs successful execution.
2. Replying: Sends an `ExecutionSucceeded` message to the requester.
3. Stopping Behavior: Stops the actor.

#### `In.ExecutionFailed` case
1. Logging: Logs the failure reason.
2. Replying: Sends an `ExecutionFailed` message to the requester.
3. Stopping Behavior: Stops the actor.

#### Helper Methods
1. readOutput: Defines a sink that reads ByteString input, converts it to a UTF-8 string, and checks if the output size exceeds the maximum allowed size.
2. src: Creates a source from an input stream.
3. run: Executes a command using `sys.runtime.exec` and returns a future of the process.

#### Detailed Workflow
1. Execution Start: When the `Execute` message is received, the actor starts by logging the event.
2. Docker Command: It then constructs and runs the Docker command with specified limits.
3. Stream Handling: Both the success and error streams from the Docker process are handled and read concurrently.
4. Output Management: The output is read and checked against the maximum allowed size.
5. File Deletion: The file is scheduled for deletion to free up memory.
6. Result Handling: The result of the execution (success or failure) is handled and appropriate messages are constructed and sent to the requester.
7. Actor Lifecycle: Depending on the message (`ExecutionSucceeded` or `ExecutionFailed`), the actor stops itself after sending the reply.

This code ensures that code execution is managed efficiently within a controlled environment (Docker) and handles different outcomes (success, failure, timeouts, and memory limits) gracefully.

Now we can move on and talk about the clustering stuff.

## 6 - Pekko Cluster

In a distributed system, efficiently managing and coordinating tasks across multiple nodes is crucial for performance and scalability. Pekko, a robust toolkit for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications, offers powerful features for creating such systems. In this context, our code should implement a cluster system with distinct roles for `worker` and `master` nodes.

#### Components and Their Roles

1. Cluster and Node Configuration:
   - The cluster is initialized using `Cluster(ctx.system)`, and the node's roles and configuration settings are obtained.

2. Worker Nodes:
   - Worker Router:
      - Each `worker` node should initialize a pool of `worker` actors using a `Round Robin` routing strategy. The pool size is configurable via `transformation.workers-per-node`.
      - The worker router is registered with the `Receptionist`, making it discoverable across the cluster.

3. Master Node:
   - Load Balancers:
      - A pool of load balancers forwards execution tasks to the worker routers. The pool size is configurable via `transformation.load-balancer`.
      - Each load balancer uses group routing to distribute tasks to remote worker routers.

4. HTTP Server:
   - The `master` node sets up an HTTP server to accept task submissions. It listens on a configurable host and port.
   - Incoming tasks are forwarded to a randomly selected load balancer, which then distributes them to the worker nodes.

#### Justification for the Components

1. Efficiency and Scalability:
   - Using a cluster setup with dedicated `worker` and `master` nodes allows for efficient task distribution and parallel processing.
   - The `Round Robin` routing of `worker` actors and load balancers ensures balanced workload distribution.

2. Dynamic Discovery and Registration:
   - The `Receptionist` enables dynamic discovery of `worker` routers across the cluster, facilitating seamless scaling and fault tolerance.

3. Robust and Resilient Execution:
   - Supervisory strategies for `worker` actors enhance fault tolerance by restarting actors on failure.
   - The use of `ask` patterns with timeouts ensures that task submissions are handled gracefully, even in the event of errors.

4. Configurability:
   - Key parameters like the number of workers, load balancers, and server settings are configurable, allowing for flexibility and adaptability to different environments and workloads.

By leveraging these components and strategies, the cluster system can efficiently manage and distribute tasks across multiple nodes, providing a robust solution for distributed computing scenarios.

Keeping in mind all this, we could translate those expectations in code:

```scala
package cluster

import workers.Worker
import org.apache.pekko
import org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.receptionist.Receptionist
import org.apache.pekko.actor.typed.scaladsl.Behaviors

import scala.util.*

object ClusterSystem:

  def apply(): Behavior[Nothing] = Behaviors.setup[Nothing]: ctx =>

    import ctx.executionContext

    val cluster = Cluster(ctx.system)
    val node = cluster.selfMember
    val cfg = ctx.system.settings.config

    if node hasRole "worker" then
      val numberOfWorkers = Try(cfg.getInt("transformation.workers-per-node")).getOrElse(50)
      // actor that sends StartExecution message to local Worker actors in a round robin fashion
      val workerRouter = ctx.spawn(
        behavior = Routers
          .pool(numberOfWorkers) {
            Behaviors
              .supervise(Worker().narrow[StartExecution])
              .onFailure(SupervisorStrategy.restart)
          }
          .withRoundRobinRouting(),
        name = "worker-router"
      )
      // actors are registered to the ActorSystem receptionist using a special ServiceKey.
      // All remote worker-routers will be registered to ClusterSystem actor system receptionist.
      // When the "worker" node starts it registers the local worker-router to the Receptionist which is cluster-wide
      // As a result "master" node can have access to remote worker-router and receive any updates about workers through worker-router
      ctx.system.receptionist ! Receptionist.Register(Worker.WorkerRouterKey, workerRouter)

    if node hasRole "master" then
      given system: ActorSystem[Nothing] = ctx.system
      given ec: ExecutionContextExecutor = ctx.executionContext
      given timeout: Timeout = Timeout(3.seconds)

      val numberOfLoadBalancers = Try(cfg.getInt("transformation.load-balancer")).getOrElse(3)
      // pool of load balancers that forward StartExecution message to the remote worker-router actors in a round robin fashion
      val loadBalancers = (1 to numberOfLoadBalancers).map: n =>
        ctx.spawn(
          behavior =
            Routers
              .group(Worker.WorkerRouterKey)
              .withRoundRobinRouting(), // routes StartExecution message to the remote worker-router
          name = s"load-balancer-$n"
        )

      val route =
        pathPrefix("lang" / Segment): lang =>
          post:
            entity(as[String]): code =>
              val loadBalancer = Random.shuffle(loadBalancers).head
              val asyncResponse = loadBalancer
                .ask[ExecutionResult](StartExecution(code, lang, _))
                .map(_.value)
                .recover(_ => "something went wrong")

              complete(asyncResponse)

      val host = Try(cfg.getString("http.host")).getOrElse("0.0.0.0")
      val port = Try(cfg.getInt("http.port")).getOrElse(8080)

      Http()
        .newServerAt(host, port)
        .bind(route)

      ctx.log.info("Server is listening on {}:{}", host, port)

    Behaviors.empty[Nothing]
```

The code above sets up an `Pekko` cluster with `worker` and `master` nodes.

1. Receptionist: Registers the `worker` routers so they can be discovered cluster-wide.
2. HTTP Server: On the `master` node, it starts an `HTTP` server to accept code execution requests.
3. Configuration: Reads settings for the number of `workers`, `load balancers`, and `HTTP` server details.
4. Worker Router: Each `worker` node creates a pool of ``worker actors using `round-robin` routing.
5. Load-Balancer: The `master` node creates `load balancers` to forward tasks to `worker` routers.

Algorithm for Code Execution:
- `HTTP POST` request with code is received.
- A random `load balancer` forwards the request to a `worker` router.
- The `worker` router assigns the task to a worker actor, which executes the code and returns the result.

With that we finish the part which is concerned with code.

Let's move on to the final part of the project - running it all locally.

## 7. Local Deployment

To deploy the project locally we should simply run `./deploy.sh` and wait to see the logs from the `worker` and `master` nodes.

For the details, please view the [README](https://github.com/Ghurtchu/braindrill/blob/main/README.md) of the original project.

The only requirement is to have the docker engine installed locally.

## 8. Simulator

To get the better feeling of how the app performs under a certain load I decided to write the `Simulator.scala` which simulates the behaviour of the concurrent users.

`Simulator.scala` must be run as a separate process, assuming that the execution engine is already started and is ready to accept requests.

To some extent, testing the load on the locally deployed cluster may not be the best idea since all the nodes are using the shared resources of the single laptop, but I had to give it a try.

The goal of the simulator is to perform aggregate the statistics of things such as:
- total requests in a minute
- average response time
- error count
- response time percentiles: p50, p90, p99

With those expectations in mind, `Simulator.scala` could look like the following:

```scala
package simulator

        )

        println(s"[$name]: sending Request($requestId, $code) at $now")

        http

Here are the important points:

1. Imports: The code uses Apache Pekko for actor-based concurrency, HTTP client, and stream processing. It also imports utilities for handling concurrency and mutable collections.

2. Actor System Setup:
   - The actor system (`SimulatorSystem`) and execution context are initialized with a configuration file (`simulator.conf`).

3. Metrics:
   - Atomic variables are used to track request counts, response times, response details, and errors.

4. Stream Definition:
   - A stream is defined to generate random codes and send HTTP POST requests to a remote server at regular intervals.
   - **`generateRandomCode`**: Generates a random code every specified interval (e.g., 160 milliseconds).
   - **`sendHttpRequest`**: Sends the generated code as an HTTP POST request and records the response time.
   - **`displayResponseTime`**: Displays the response time for each request.

5. Stream Execution:
   - The stream is run with the name "simulator" and an interval of 160 milliseconds.

6. Metrics Logging:
   - Every 60 seconds, the code logs metrics such as the number of requests, average response time, error count, and response time percentiles (p50, p90, p99).

7. Utility Methods:
   - **`randomId`**: Generates a random request ID.
   - **`percentile`**: Calculates response time percentiles from recorded data.

8. Enum and Object Definitions:
   - **`Code` Enum**: Defines various types of codes (e.g., `MemoryIntensive`, `CPUIntensive`).
   - **`Python` Object**: Contains Python code snippets for different tasks.

This setup continuously sends HTTP requests, tracks metrics, and periodically logs performance data.

Please, run it and share the performance details with me, feel free to play with numbers as well :)

## 9. Conclusion

In this blog post, we've explored the journey of building a robust, scalable, and efficient remote code execution engine using Scala 3 and Apache Pekko. Our system leverages a master-worker architecture, with one master node and three worker nodes to distribute and manage code execution tasks across a cluster. Let's recap the key components and features of our solution.

#### Key Components and Features

1. Cluster Awareness with Receptionist and Router:
   - By using `Receptionist` and `Router`, we ensured our system is cluster-aware, allowing dynamic scaling and efficient task distribution among worker nodes.

2. Actors for Task Management:
   - `Worker`: Coordinates tasks on the worker nodes, ensuring seamless processing and communication with the master node.
   - `FileHandler`: Manages file preparation required for code execution.
   - `CodeExecutor`: Executes the code snippets in a sibling docker container and collects the output.

3. Docker-out-of-Docker (DooD) Approach:
   - Each worker node runs as a Docker container, and within these containers, we utilize the DooD approach to execute sibling containers. This method provides isolation and security, ensuring each code execution happens in a controlled and disposable environment.

4. Resource Management and Security:
   - We've set stringent resource limits (CPU, RAM) and a 2-second timeout for code execution. These measures protect the system from malicious code, such as infinite loops, ensuring stability and security.

5. Support for Multiple Languages:
   - Our engine supports six programming languages, demonstrating its versatility and adaptability to various use cases.

#### Scalability and Efficiency

The design choices made in this project ensure that our remote code execution engine can scale efficiently with the demands. By distributing the workload across multiple worker nodes and dynamically managing these nodes using cluster-aware techniques, we can handle a large number of concurrent code execution requests without compromising performance.

#### Final Thoughts

Building this distributed system with Scala 3 and Apache Pekko has been an enlightening experience. We've harnessed the power of actor-based concurrency, cluster management, and containerization to create a resilient and secure remote code execution engine. This project exemplifies how modern technologies can be integrated to solve complex problems in a scalable and efficient manner.
